Set olFldr = olNS.Folders("Operations").Folders("Inbox").Folders("EOD_Blotter")

This is the problematic code, this code assume that 'Operations' folder is on the root level.
In most cases, a custom folder like "Operations" is not at the root level. It is usually a subfolder within your primary mailbox.

- Your Mailbox
- Operations  <-- The code is looking for it here, at the same level Your Mailbox
- Archives


Possible Scenario: 
- Your Mailbox
  - Inbox
  - Sent Items
  - Operations  <-- The folder is actually here
    - Inbox
      - EOD_Blotter

To Verify is we can check the list of directory of the root level. 

For Each Folder In olNS.Folders
    Debug.Print Folder.Name
